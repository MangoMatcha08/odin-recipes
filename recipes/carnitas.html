    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Here's a recipe I learned during the pandemic! Easy to make, but takes a good amount of time to get right.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork butt/shoulder (bone-in skin on preferred)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Oregano (powdered is easier to use as rub)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Orange Juice</li>
        <li>Diced Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and dry pork. Rub salt and pepper onto pork.</li>
        <li>Combine Cumin, oregano, and olive oil together. Rub mixture onto pork. Make sure to get the edges/crevices</li>
        <li>Place in slowcooker after applying the rub. Make sure skin side is up.</li>
        <li>Add onion and orange juice to cooker. Arrangement of ingredients in the cooker does not matter.</li>
        <li>Cook for 12 hrs on low for best results</li>
        <li>After the pork is finished cooking, shred pork with a fork.</li>
        <li>(Optional) Pan fry pork, take some of the juices from the cooker and add. Will carmelize via Orange juice that was placed in the cooker before.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
